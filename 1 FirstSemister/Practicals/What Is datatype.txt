Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.

There are four types of datatypes
1) Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: 
a) integer types and 
b) floating-point types.

2) Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.

3) The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.

4) Derived types
a) Pointer types
b) Array types
c) Structure types
d) Union types
e) Function types.

mainly three data types we used and they are
1) int : Integers are whole numbers that can have both zero, positive and negative values but no decimal values. 
For Example : 3,-3,9,0

2) float : float and double are used to hold real numbers.
For Example : 3.14, 5.7,6.11

3) char : Keyword char is used for declaring character type variables. The size of the character variable is 1 byte.
For Example : 'a', 'A', '@', '6'
