=<:>=<:>=<:> My Daily Routine <:>=<:>=<:>=

My day begins at 9 AM when I wake up. I spend a few minutes in bed checking my mobile for any updates and reading tech news headlines. It’s the first thing I do to stay connected with the latest happenings in the technology world. Afterwards, I get out of bed, brush my teeth, and freshen up for the day ahead. I then enjoy a cup of tea, which helps me kickstart my day, while I continue to browse tech articles and updates on my phone.

By the time I finish my tea, it’s time for breakfast. My mom prepares breakfast for me, and I enjoy a healthy meal. After eating, I focus on my studies. I dedicate some time to personal learning, whether it’s for job preparation or enhancing my skills. Following my study session, I head to the bathroom for a refreshing bath, which gets me ready for the day.

Once I’m fresh and dry, I get dressed and comb my hair to ensure I’m fully ready. I pack my backpack with my laptop and other necessary devices, making sure I have everything I need. After that, I head out to Krishna Bhagat’s home, where I spend around 3-4 hours studying. During this time, we focus on various subjects and prepare ourselves for future career opportunities, particularly job readiness.

After our study session at Krishna Bhagat’s place, I return home. Upon arrival, I relax with another cup of tea and enjoy a hearty lunch. Then, I prepare for my English-speaking class, which takes place from 5:30 to 6:30 PM. Since the class is about 6-7 km away from home, I spend 20-25 minutes travelling there. During the class, I practice speaking English and engage in small chats to improve my communication skills.

Once the English class ends, I head to Codemate Institute for my evening teaching session. From 7 to 8 PM, I teach Python programming with a focus on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This is an important part of my routine, as it allows me to share my knowledge and help others grow in their programming skills.

After my teaching session, I head back home, where I wash my face and settle in to unwind. I open my laptop to watch YouTube videos or catch up on anime episodes for about an hour. This is my time to relax and enjoy my favourite content. 

By the time I finish watching videos, it’s dinner time. My mom calls me for dinner, and I enjoy a wholesome meal with the family. After dinner, I go for a 20-minute walk to get some fresh air and clear my mind. This is a good time to reflect on the day and prepare myself for the evening.

Once I’m back home, I return to my room for some more study. I read articles or study topics relevant to my personal growth and career development. By midnight, I feel sleepy, so I turn off the lights, play soft music, and prepare for a healthy sleep, knowing that I’ll be ready to start another productive day the next morning.
